**Description:** The Log Data Visualization project aims to provide users with an intuitive and interactive tool for transforming raw log data into actionable visual insights. The system allows users to upload log data files, select the type of chart they want to generate, and view visual representations of the data. The frontend, developed using ReactJS and styled with CSS, offers a simple and stylish user interface for easy navigation and interaction. The backend, built with SpringBoot, processes the uploaded data and generates the necessary chart data. MySQL serves as the database to store and manage log data efficiently. This project is designed to help IT professionals and security analysts monitor performance, identify issues, and make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.
